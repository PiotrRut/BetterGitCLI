> Disclaimer: BetterGitCLI is **not** official GitHub software, nor is it in any way affiliated with GitHub.

BetterGitCli is a third party GitHub CLI made with Python, providing easier access to managing your
GitHub account directly from your shell with simple and intuitive UI. It's based on [PyGithub](https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/) which is a wrapper library around the official GitHub REST API.

## Configuration

See below for instructions on how to configure BetterGitCLI. Note that Python 3.6 or higher is required to run this program.

### GitHub access

In order to gain access to your GitHub account you will need to authenticate with your GitHub access token. You can find instructions
on how to obtain it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Your token must grant access to _"repo"_, _"user"_, _"delete_repo"_ and _"admin:public_key"_. After generating
your token, export it as an environmental variable in your shell üëáüèª

```bash
# bash / zsh
$ export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>

# powershell
$env:GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN = "token"
```

üö® BetterGitCLI will never store your access token, and it will *only be stored locally* on your machine.

### Installation
You can either install this program using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) or [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), or clone it and run locally with Python. Click on one of the
options down below to reveal the instructions üëáüèª

  <summary><i><b>Clone and run locally with Python</b></i></summary>
  <p>

  If you prefer to clone this repository and run BetterGitCLI locally using your Python interpreter, you can
  do that as well. Just remember that in this case you will have to install these dependencies manually:

  - *PyInquirer, PyGithub, colorama*

  This can be done easily using the provided `requirements.txt` file by running this in the project root:
  ```bash
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  After installation, run the program inside the `/better_git_cli` directory:

  ```bash
  $ python main.py
  ```

  </p>
